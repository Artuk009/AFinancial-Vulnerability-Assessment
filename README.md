# AFinancial-Vulnerability-Assessment
In this assessment I conduct manual and static vulnerability testing for a fictional organization named Artemis Financial.

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
* Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). They are seeking Global Rain’s expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats. It is my job to examine the web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities and document findings in a vulnerability report to be used for mitigation.

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
*

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
*

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
*

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
*

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
*

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
