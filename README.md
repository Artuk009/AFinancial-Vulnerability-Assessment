# AFinancial-Vulnerability-Assessment
In this assessment I conduct manual and static vulnerability testing for a fictional organization named Artemis Financial.

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
* Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). They are seeking Global Rain’s expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats. It is my job to examine the web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities and document findings in a vulnerability report to be used for mitigation.

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
* I documented each of the potential vulnerabilities found while manually scanning the application code so that they can be reviewed and resolved in future coding steps. Additionally, I ran an OWASP vulnerability scan to detect vulnerabilities. For any that were submitted to the report, I researched to find the CVE designation and created brief descriptions of what the vulnerabilities entail and a possible resolution.

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
* The OWASP dependency HTML report helped reference which CVE designations were afflicting the reported vulnerability. This made it easy to quickly research each of the problems using NIST and then submit findings to the report.

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
* 

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
*

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
*

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
*
